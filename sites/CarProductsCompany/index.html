				<p class="words">Blending techniques give you another level of creative 
					control. You can create unique effects by blending the colors 
					in overlapping objects. Fireworks has several blending modes
					to help you achieve the look you want. 
					Masking gives you creative control over layers and objects.
					You can apply masks and blending modes from the 
					Layers panel. You can also create masks using options on the
					Select and Modify menus. You can use a vector 
					object or a bitmap object to block out part of the underlying
					image. For example, if you want to block out part of a 
					photograph so that it appears to have an elliptical frame
					around it, you can paste an elliptical shape as a mask on 
					top of the photograph. All areas outside the ellipse 
					disappear as if cropped, showing only the part of the picture 
					inside the ellipse.
